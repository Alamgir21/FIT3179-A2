                <p>Australia is home to a wide variety of cultures and is
                    a popular destination for tourists from around the world. The data presented here highlights the vast variety of travellers
                    that visit Australia each year, as well as the significant contribution that tourism makes to the Australian economy.
                    Below Tourism density is used to normalise the data. It is simply calculated by dividing the total number of tourists from each country
                    by the total land mass of that country.

                <p>This allows us to see which countries have the highest proportion of their population
                    visiting Australia, rather than just looking at the raw number of visitors. For example, while China may have a high
                    number of visitors to Australia, its large land mass means that the proportion of Chinese people visiting Australia is
                    relatively low compared to smaller countries with fewer visitors but also smaller landmasses. Landmass was used instead of population since 
                    population data changes over time but landmass remains constant in most cases.

            <p> This graph shows the total number of international visitors to each state in Australia from 2005 to 2020.
                We can see that New South Wales and Victoria have the highest number of international visitors, while
                Tasmania and the Northern Territory have the lowest. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as
                population size, tourist attractions, and accessibility. Overall, this graph provides insight into the
                distribution of international tourism across Australia.</p>
