                <p>Australia is home to a wide variety of cultures and is
                    a popular destination for tourists from around the world. The data presented here highlights the vast variety of travellers
                    that visit Australia each year, as well as the significant contribution that tourism makes to the Australian economy.
                    Below Tourism density is used to normalise the data. It is simply calculated by dividing the total number of tourists from each country
                    by the total land mass of that country.

                <p>This allows us to see which countries have the highest proportion of their population
                    visiting Australia, rather than just looking at the raw number of visitors. For example, while China may have a high
                    number of visitors to Australia, its large land mass means that the proportion of Chinese people visiting Australia is
                    relatively low compared to smaller countries with fewer visitors but also smaller landmasses. Landmass was used instead of population since 
                    population data changes over time but landmass remains constant in most cases.

                <p>As seen above, the summer period from December to February is the peak season for international visitors to Australia.
                    This is likely due to a combination of factors, including the holiday season in many countries,
                    favorable weather conditions in Australia during this time, and school holidays.

                <p> The data also shows
                    a significant drop in international visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which is expected
                    due to travel restrictions and border closures implemented to curb the spread of the virus.
                    Overall, this graph provides insight into the seasonal patterns of international tourism in Australia
                    and highlights the impact of external factors such as the pandemic on travel trends.

                <p>Tourism within the Australian states varies significantly, with some states attracting far more international visitors
                    than others. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the presence of popular tourist attractions,
                    accessibility, and population size. For example, New South Wales and Victoria are home to major cities like Sydney
                    and Melbourne, which are popular destinations for tourists. In contrast, states like Tasmania and the Northern Territory
                    may have fewer international visitors due to their smaller populations and more remote locations.

                    Uluru, and the beaches of the Gold Coast. Additionally, states with diverse landscapes and outdoor activities,
                    such as Queensland and Western Australia, may also attract more international visitors. Overall,
                    the distribution of international visitors across Australian states highlights the importance of various factors
                    in shaping tourism patterns.

            <p> Tourism play a much smaller role in the overall economy. Not to say it is insiginifanct
                however, as seen in the pie chart above, tourism contributes to around 3.1% of Australia's GDP in 2023-24.
                This is a significant increase from previous years, likely due to the recovery of the tourism industry following
                the COVID-19 pandemic. The pie chart also shows that domestic tourism makes up a larger portion of the tourism GDP
                compared to international tourism. This highlights the importance of domestic travel in supporting the Australian economy.
                Overall, while tourism may not be the largest contributor to Australia's GDP, it still plays a vital role in the country's economy
                and provides employment opportunities for many Australians.
